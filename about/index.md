Hello world !
I never thought I'd be here on Earth.
My IQ is normal, but I still working hard with poor memory.
Likes to toss and turn, interested in everything.
Slightly strong in science, weak in arts, kindergarten level in drawing, alien aesthetics...
I'm a techie, digital nerd.
I used to be skinny, but now I'm overworked and fat.
My dream is to make money first, and then change the world a little bit.
Idol: Lei Jun, Musk
